Behaviour and parallelization strategies

The //@ parallel membarrier pragma may be used to insert a full memory fence at a given location.

Special care must be taken when reads and writes of shared variables are done by multiple threads, 
as a wide array of optimizations such as instruction reordering or data caching may break your code 
on multi-core machines. In such cases, it is useful to be able to introduce special instructions called 
memory barriers. The introduction of such an instruction guarantees that no read / write operations 
are reordered relative to it and also that all the values of shared variables are read from main memory, 
rather than each core’s private cache.

Please note that synchronization mechanisms such as locks introduce memory fences implicitly, 
so there is no need for an explicit fence in these situations.
