Behaviour and parallelization strategies

The //@ parallel atomic pragma may be used directly above a single variable update to signify 
that it should be an atomic operation. Accepted operations are +=, -=, ++ and -- on an int or 
long variable.

The result of the conversion is a call to one of the methods:
- Interlocked.Increment for ++.
- Interlocked.Decrement for --.
- Interlocked.Add for += and -=.
Note that for a single variable update, serialization via the atomic pragma is much faster than 
using the lock pragma, as it uses non-blocking locks.
